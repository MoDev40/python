# Basic Exercise One
## #1 Smart calculator

write a python program that takes `2 numbers` from `user` and `print` out:
- Their sum
- Their difference
- Their product
- Their quotient (division result)
- The reminder when divided

Make sure the program handles both `integers` and `floats` correctly.

# #2 Variable swaping without temporary variable
create two variable `a=5` and `b=10` swap without third variable.

# #3 Type Mixing
imagine you are coding a shopping system
```python
item = 'Pen'
price = 2.5
quantity= 4
```
make python print
```txt
You bougth 4 Pens for total of 10.0 dollars.
```
using only string concatenation (+) and type conversion not f string.
