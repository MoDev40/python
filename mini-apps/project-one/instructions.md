# Exercise from introduction to match instructions

1. **Inventory System**
   Create a program that manages a shop’s inventory using dictionaries and lists. It should allow adding, removing, updating, and searching products by name or category.

2. **Student Gradebook**
   Build a gradebook where students (tuples of name, ID) have multiple subjects and scores stored in a dictionary. Calculate average, highest, and lowest scores for each student and for the entire class.

3. **Bank Account Simulator**
   Write a program that simulates multiple bank accounts. Each account has an ID, owner name, and balance. Support deposit, withdraw, transfer between accounts, and show transaction history.

4. **Task Scheduler with Priorities**
   Design a task manager where each task has a title, description, deadline, and priority. Use sets and conditionals to avoid duplicate tasks. Implement filtering (e.g., show all urgent tasks due today).

5. **Contact Manager with Match Statement**
   Develop a contact manager that stores people’s names, phone numbers, and emails. Use a `match` statement to handle user actions: add, update, search, or delete contacts.
